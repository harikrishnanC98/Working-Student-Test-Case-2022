students = [("Allen Anderson", "Computer Science"),
			("Edgar Einstein", "Engineering"),
            ("Farrah Finn", "Fine Arts")]
def add_new_student(students, name, major):
	students.append((name, major))
def update_student(students, index, name, major):
	students[index] = (name, major)
def find_students_by_name(students, name):
	return [student for student in students if name in student[0]]
def get_all_majors(students):
	return [student[1] for student in students]
	
The conclusion from the code snippet(acceptable answers):
1. In the update_student function, the '(' and ')' parentheses can be removed without
   causing any errors.
2. Calling find_students_by_name(students, 'in') returns a list of 2 tuples.
3. The add_new_student function adds a new student in the last place in the list.
